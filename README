Application that will hopefully help me with shopping orders from my wife.

In order to build, you have to install Oracle jdbc driver artifact in local Maven repository, eg.:

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=./ojdbc14.jar -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc14 -Dversion=10.2.0.2 -Dpackaging=jar

You can find the ojdbc jar in your Oracle installation.
